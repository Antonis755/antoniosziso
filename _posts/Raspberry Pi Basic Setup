## Raspberry Pi Basic Setup

I did a college project a few years ago where I had to get a Raspberry Pi and collaborate with other students; since then, I've kept the Pi and use it for various things that might be useful. 
For this purpose I did a fersh install by downloading the [ISO](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), then I did use a media write like BalenaEtcher or feodra media writer. The link provides media writers for Windows, Ubuntu and Mac.
I use Fedora OS and fedora media writer come in hand, so I pluged in my usb to sd and select ISO, sd and click write, once its done we are ready to go!



I want to mention here that I use the graphic Raspberry os, but there are many other available that you can search for and install.
